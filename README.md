# DVD Logo Mini-Game
A game based on the DVD Screensaver meme! Take control of the logo and try to make it hit the corner in as little moves as possible!

## How to Play   
Use your arrows keys or WASD keys to move the DVD logo into a corner. You will need precision and good timing to do it in as few moves as possible. Each time the logo hits a corner you advance a level. The more levels you complete the faster the logo moves, and the more difficult it becomes to control. What will your highscore be?

## Known Issues
- Games Plays Itself AFK (Duhh)
  a) I plan on fixing this by adding obstacles you have to manuver around, if the game is left open the logo will hit these obstacles causing a game over.
- After a certain level, the speed of the DVD logo means it instantly reaches a corner
  a) I plan to fix this by adding a max speed, and just increasing difficulty after you've reached this max speed by introducing obstacles and/or a move/time limit.
  
## Notes on Possible Additions
I think obstacles would be a great addition, but their position per level should not be hardcoded but rather random. I will need to spend a significant amount of time figuring out how to ensure the level is still beatable with the positions of randomly generated obstacles.

## In-Development Additions  
- Add a per level challenge, either time based or move based, or maybe even obstacles.
- Add Highscore Display (Either in time or moves)
- Add Game over screen-based on per level limiter

## Possible Future Additions  
- Server/DB to Store Highscores, Player Data, Maybe Even Have Accounts
- Add mobile support
- Multiplayer
