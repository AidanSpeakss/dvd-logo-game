# DVD Logo Mini-Game
A game based on the DVD Screensaver meme! Take control of the logo and try to make it hit the corner in as little moves as possible!

## How to Play   
Use your arrows keys or WASD keys to move the DVD logo into a corner. You will need precision and good timing to do it in as few moves as possible. Each time the logo hits a corner you advance a level. The more levels you complete the fast the logo moves, and the more difficult it becomes to control. What will your highscore be?

## In-Development Additions:  
- Add a per level challenge, either time based or move based, or maybe even obstacles.
- Add Highscore Display (Either in time or moves)
- Add Game over screen-based on per level limiter

## Possible Future Additions:  
- Server/DB to Store Highscores, Player Data, Maybe Even Have Accounts
- Add mobile support
- Multiplayer
